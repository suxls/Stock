Stock Simulation  <br/>  

- Reads daily closing-price of stock market information from API calls based on company ticker symbol
- Design follows the Model-View-Controller Structure
- Supports a text-based interface or graphical interface
- JSwing for Graphical Interface, JUnit4 for testing

Within the Graphical Interface a user can:
- create portfolios that's saved locally and can be accessed again after closing the program.
- purchase and sell stock within a portfolio.
- view the value of the portfolio based on a specific date by calculating the closing price of each stock.

Within the Text-Based Interface a user can:
- Support all the above
- finding information on stock such as crossovers, moving average, etc.
- Visualize graph of a stock/portfolio's performace within a certain time frame.

**Note**: Since this assignment belongs to Northeastern's CS3500 course. By instructor policy, source code can only be accessed by request.
